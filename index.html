                <div class="faq-question">
                    Q: Why do you claim this impacts all $42.5 billion? I thought the reconciliation bill only adds $500 million to BEAD?
                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p><strong>The legal trap is more devastating than it appears.</strong> While the bill appropriates only $500 million in new BEAD funding, the moratorium applies to <em>any state that accepts any amount of BEAD funding on or after the bill's enactment</em>.</p>
                    
                    <p>Here's how the entire $42.5 billion becomes hostage:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All $42.45 billion from the 2021 Infrastructure Act has been "obligated" to states but not yet fully spent</li>
                        <li>If a state accepts even $1 of the new $500 million, the moratorium kicks in for that state</li>
                        <li>The Department of Commerce can then "deobligate" (take back) previously allocated funds for violations</li>
                        <li>Once funds are deobligated, states must comply with the moratorium to get any future BEAD money back</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>It's a legal mousetrap: states that initially refuse the $500 million can still lose billions in previously allocated funding through administrative action, then be forced to comply with the AI moratorium to restore those funds.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">
                    Q: Has Congress ever done anything like this before? What makes this different?
                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p><strong>No—not at this scale or for this duration.</strong> Congress has sometimes preempted state rules in mature industries like telecom or aviation, but this is unprecedented:</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>What makes this a historic overreach:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It covers <strong>every use of AI</strong>, in <strong>every sector</strong>, across <strong>all 50 states</strong></li>
                        <li>It creates a regulatory vacuum <strong>before Congress has passed any federal AI rules</strong></li>
                        <li>It lasts <strong>a full decade</strong>—longer than any technology-related preemption in U.S. history</li>
                        <li>It uses infrastructure funding as leverage to strip states' constitutional police powers</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Previous preemptions replaced state rules with federal oversight. This eliminates oversight entirely while emerging AI technology poses unprecedented risks to workers, children, and democracy itself. It's not coordination—it's a complete regulatory freeze that benefits only Big Tech monopolies.</p>
